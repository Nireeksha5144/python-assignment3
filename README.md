Task 1: Finding the factorial means multiplying a number by all the numbers below it down to 1. For example, 5 factorial is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. It helps in counting and arranging things in math.

Task 2: This task is about finding the square root, logarithm, and sine of a number using Python. Square root gives the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the original. Logarithm tells the power to which a base must be raised to get the number. Sine gives the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.
